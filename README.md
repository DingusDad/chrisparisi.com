I needed a portfolio, and what better way to show what I have learned then by building the portfolio from scratch.

This project had a lot of firsts for me. First time using a CMS like Sanity. First time using Sass and Framer Motion as well.

Using Sass for this project probably was my biggest eye opener. I learned how much I loved using nested properties and making my CSS more modular and easier to maintain. I now try to use Sass on most my projects now.

Using Sanity as a CMS was very easy and straightforward. I orginally wanted to use a CMS for another project for a client where it seemed like a good fit, and this allowed me to get some experience before implementing it for them. It really makes it super easy and quick to update things on my portfolio without having to change up the code, which is a trait a client may greatly appreciate.

Framer Motion was very fun to use and I feel really made my portfolio feel more high-end. There were some issues with trying to implement some more complex animations, like making an already animated background slide into view. But this allowed me to reinforce my belief that performance and usability is more important to clients and end-users than trying to throw as many flashy extras as I can just because I know how to.
